I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science), advised by Prof. [Alex gittens](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/). In the summer of 2020, I joined the RPI-IBM [Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration(AIRC)](https://airc.rpi.edu) program as a scholar, under the supervision of [Shashanka Ubaru](https://shashankaubaru.github.io) and [Lior Horesh](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-lhoresh).

Research Interest
======
My research focuses on using randomized linear algebra(RandNLA) tools to quantifiably trade off accuracy with computation time. My work lies in obtaining low-rank approximations for ML models(e.g. Matrix completion, Tensor Decomposition). I am also curious about exploring the possibilities of leveraging these RandNLA techniques in Deep Learning settings(e.g. Low rank attention in Efficient Transformer).

[Here](/cv/) is my CV.

Misc. interests
======
I love traveling and taking photos. Most of my recent photography work is done using either medium format or large format cameras. You can find most of my works (in low resolution) on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jurohd_/) account. You can always reach out to me to acquire the raw files for archival-quality prints.

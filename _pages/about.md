*I will be joining [Walmart Global Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmartglobaltech/)'s search ranking team as Senior Data Scientist.*

I earn my PhD in computer science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science), advised by Prof. [Alex Gittens](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/). From summer 2020 to summer 2023, I was an scholar of the RPI-IBM [Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration(AIRC)](https://airc.rpi.edu) program, under the supervision of [Shashanka Ubaru](https://shashankaubaru.github.io) and [Lior Horesh](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-lhoresh).

Research Interest
======
My research focuses on using randomized linear algebra(RandNLA) tools to quantifiably trade off accuracy with computation time. My work lies in obtaining low-rank approximations for ML models(e.g. Matrix completion, Tensor Decomposition). I am also curious about exploring the possibilities of leveraging these RandNLA techniques in Deep Learning settings.

[Here](/cv/) is my CV.

Misc. interests
======
I love traveling and taking photos. Most of my recent photography work is done using either medium format or large format film cameras. You can find most of my works (in low resolution) on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jurohd_/) account. You can always [reach out to me](mailto:jurohd@gmail.com) to acquire the raw files for archival-quality prints.  

I also engage in Texas Hold'em poker during my free time, playing both online and offline. I am a profitable poker player at GGpoker(NL200 Zoom level).

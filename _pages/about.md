I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science), advised by Prof. [Alex gittens](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/). I am also a Rensselaer-IBM [Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration(AIRC)](https://airc.rpi.edu) scholar, under the supervision of [Shashanka Ubaru](https://shashankaubaru.github.io) and [Lior Horesh](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-lhoresh).

[Here](/CV/) is my CV.

Research Interest
======
My research focuses on using randomized linear algebra(RandNLA) tools to quantifiably trade off accuracy with computation time. My work lies in obtaining low-rank approximations for ML models. I am also curious about exploring whether these RandNLA techniques can be extended to the DL settings(e.g Efficient Transformer).

Misc. interests
======
I love traveling and taking photos. Most of my recent photography work is done using either medium format or large format camers. You can find most of my works (in low resolution) on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jurohd_/) account. You can always reach out to me to acquire the raw files for archival-quality prints.  

I am also a recreational No-Limit Hold'em Poker player. Most of the games I played are cash games(\\$2/\\$5) but I occasionally participate in tournament as well.
